# Challenge for a Data Scientist position

## Objective
Go through this real world example of work that would be done by a Data Scientist at AXA Digital. The idea is that we don't want something that is perfect. We want to see how you think about problems, how you deal with issues at scale, and how you feel about the technical work.

- This assessment is designed for only a few hours of your time.
- Please provide all code in Python.


### PART 1
1. You have historical 1 minute price data of BTC/BUSD. We want you first to transform data types to a more appropriate format for further analysis.

Please note any data quality issues you encountered and how you did solve those as it can be a very likely problem in production environment.

### PART 2
2. Perform an exploratory analysis on the moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA). Which do you find to have a better success rate given your analysis, are  longer or shorter lookback periods in MA and EMA?

Show your work, results, present a case, and describe your findings.

### PART 3
3. Implement a simple machine learning, AI - or any other model of your choice - that can help look for other patterns in your dataset results. Pick out the best signals and aggregate the results.

Explain your reasoning for choosing the your models and describe the patterns you are finding across your data.

### BONUS
4. Using the signals from your best signal picks in step 3, create another machine learning models which compounds your findings to further evaluate.

Do you see any new patterns from your results? Explain your reasoning and show your work.
